tapestry5-high
==============

tapestry5.4 components for highcharts and highstock.

Note that while this library is Apache v2 license, both highcharts and highstock have their own license.
See http://shop.highsoft.com/highcharts.html and http://shop.highsoft.com/highstock.html.

This project took a lot of inspiration from the tapestry5-highcharts library
(https://github.com/got5/tapestry5-highcharts) but migrates it to tapestry 5.4 and add Highstock support.
